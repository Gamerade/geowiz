# Replit Prompt: Geography Wizard - The Ultimate Capital, Flag & Outline Challenge

"Think you know your world? Build an immersive geography trivia game that goes beyond basic questions. Here's the challenge:"

## Overview
Create a visually polished and intuitive geography trivia game that blends fun and learning. Move beyond simple text prompts by building a slick user interface (UI) that feels modern and immersive, akin to the style of games like Seterra or GeoGuessr.

### Core Game Modes
Each question should fall into one of the following themed categories:

1. **Mispronounced Capitals** – Test knowledge on capitals people often say wrong.
2. **Countries with Multiple Capitals** – Throw curveballs with countries like South Africa.
3. **Hidden Outlines** – Show partially blurred or silhouetted map shapes.
4. **Flag Quirks** – Ask questions based on visual oddities or histories of flags.
5. **Mystery Mix** – Unexpected geography trivia: microstates, high-altitude capitals, border oddities.

### Regional Focus
Let users choose their challenge from:
- **Global Challenge** – All countries.
- **Continents** – e.g., Europe, Asia, Africa.
- **Subregions** – e.g., Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe.
- **Custom Sets** – User-defined challenges.

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, intuitive layout with visual navigation.
- Region/category selection via buttons or dropdown.
- Visual prompts (flag images, map outlines, etc.).
- Smooth transitions between questions.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Clear feedback after each question: result, rank, and a cultural/local fun fact.

## Game Flow
- Present one question at a time (no multiple choice).
- After each answer:
  - Validate and show correct/incorrect feedback.
  - Give a quirky nickname or rank (e.g., "Cartography Sorcerer", "Lost Luggage Rookie").
  - Show a delightful local secret/fact.
- Loop until user types or clicks “Stop the Adventure.”

## Technical Requirements
- Use Python with a UI framework like PyWebIO or integrate with Replit's web UI tools.
- Store questions and facts in JSON or structured dictionaries/lists.
- Randomize categories and questions.
- Modular code structure: functions for each round, UI handler, data loader.
- Track score, progress, and best nickname.

## Bonus Features (Optional but Awesome)
- ASCII or graphical map art for outlines.
- Leaderboard or high score memory.
- Sound effects for correct/wrong answers.
- Themed intros (e.g. "You're entering the Mispronunciation Matrix...").

## Example Snippet
```python
from pywebio.input import input
from pywebio.output import put_text

put_text("You're entering the Flag Quirks Zone...")
question = "Which country has a flag with an AK-47 on it?"
answer = input(question)
if answer.lower().strip() == "mozambique":
    put_text("Correct! Geography Gladiator unlocked. Did you know their flag also features a book and a hoe?")
else:
    put_text("Nope! It was Mozambique. But hey, you’re still a Compass Cadet!")
```
